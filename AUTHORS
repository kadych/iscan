"Image Scan! for Linux" was originally written by Noriyoshi Sasaki with
help from Peter J. Schretlen.

The "burden" of continued development and maintenance was passed on to
Olaf Meeuwissen during the final stages of preparation for the release
of version 1.4.0 and Narihiro Matsukuma joined during the preparations
for 1.6.0 and helped out on and off until 1.14.0.  Huynh Tuan Anh lend
a hand with 2.2.0 and 2.3.0.  Nguyen Trang Nhung helped out with 2.8.0.
Alesh Slovak joined development in the early stages of 2.14.0 and took
over the torch starting with the 2.20.0 release.

The following people have contributed:

  Ross Boylan           added resultion info to PNG images
  Tobias Kramer         pointed out a GTK deficiency wrt locale numerics
                        that wrecked havoc on the GIMP plugin
  Olaf Meeuwissen       rewrote the build system from scratch to use the
                        GNU autotools; upgraded the i18n framework; went
                        thru the trouble of pruning all unnecessary bits
                        from the sources (well, most at least); upgraded
                        the sane-backends bits; merged most changes from
                        the epson backend; overhauled the RPM spec file;
                        completely redid the supported device info; made
                        an interpreter module to make the epkowa backend
                        work in the absence of any libesint*.so (it also
                        lead to more readable code in epkowa.c); removed
                        the most proprietary bits from the sources
  Johannes Meixner      provided some ideas to improve the RPM packaging
                        thru his spec files for the iscan-free and iscan
                        packages from SUSE; sent patches to fix compiler
                        warnings; found a buffer overflow in the backend
                        debugging code and confirmed the fix
  Dirk O. Siebnich      provided the initial patch that inspired support
                        for non-i386 builds
  Thomas Harding        provided the initial changes to fix installation
                        conflicts with Debian's libsane-extras package
  Khaled Hosny          contributed Arabic translations
  Kåre Särs             pointed out bugs in backend options that are not
                        used by iscan but may be used through other SANE
                        frontends
