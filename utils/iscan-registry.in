'`basename $0`' updates the run-time data for @PACKAGE_NAME@

Usage: $0 --help | --version
       $0 --add <spec>
       $0 --remove <spec>

@PACKAGE_NAME@ plugins may need to (un)register themselves.
This utility gives plugins a common interface to do just that.  You
should not need to use this utility manually.

The following options are supported:

  -h, --help              displays this message and exit
  -v, --version           displays program version and exit

  -a, --add               adds a plugin to the run-time data
  -r, --remove            removes a plugin from the run-time data

The following <spec>s are supported:

  interpreter usb <vendor-id> <product-id> <plugin> [<firmware>]

The <vendor-id> and <product-id> are the USB IDs in hexadecimal
notation, prefixed with '0x'.  <plugin> and optional <firmware>
are pathnames to the corresponding files.
Note that the <plugin> pathname should not include an extension.
